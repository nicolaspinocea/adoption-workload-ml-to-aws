# SageMaker Pipeline: Training, Evaluation, Model Registration, and Data Baseline

This notebook enables the development of an end-to-end SageMaker Pipeline designed to:

- Train a machine learning model.
- Evaluate its performance.
- Register the trained model in the SageMaker Model Registry.
- Add a data baseline for monitoring data quality and drift.

The pipeline provides a structured and automated approach to managing the ML lifecycle using Amazon SageMaker.
